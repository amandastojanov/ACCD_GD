# Project 4 Anim-instrument

## Part A
For project 4 we will be creating a musical instrument that can be played by pressing different keys. When you press a key your program should play a sound and trigger an animation. For the first part of this assignment, create between 5 - 26 different sketches that have their own distinct sound / animation combo. Make sure each animation is encapsulated inside of a function. Think about the relationship between sound and motion? What motions make sense with what sounds?


## Part B
Now that you have all of your animations created, combine them all into one larger sketch so that you can play your instrument.
